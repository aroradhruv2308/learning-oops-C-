# CLASSES AND OBJECT
### why not structure????

the main reason why classes were introduce although the structure was present was classes come with one feature of private  and public variables. the structure is basically the public members 
its variables can be accessed through any function but in case of the classes there are two members inside it that are public and the private the public members are like structure only but the private can only be accesed through class variables
introduced in the public code. Hence the key difference is  the members of classes are private by default where as in the structure the members are public by default

### how to declare the class
classes are easy to instancetiate. We'll learn the part to define the class later in this chapter but for now you must know how to define the class its easy </br>
```
//for class name student 
student A;
```
here we declared the class of student
