# CLASSES AND OBJECT
### why not structure????

the main reason why classes were introduce although the structure was present was classes come with one feature of private  and public variables. the structure is basically the public members 
its variables can be accessed through any function but in case of the classes there are two members inside it that are public and the private the public members are like structure only but the private can only be accesed through class variables
introduced in the public code. Hence the key difference is  the members of classes are private by default where as in the structure the members are public by default

### how to declare the class
classes are easy to instancetiate. We'll learn the part to define the class later in this chapter but for now you must know how to define the class its easy </br>
```
//for class name student 
student A;
```
here we declared the class of student 

### POP && OOP??

pop is procedural oriented language in this type of language the programme is divided in to mini programms so that the whole work in the programm can be divided into various segments in the pop the data is not given the importance the data moves freely along the whole programme but the main focus is given to the procedure
In pop the global data is made if you need to make that data access to several functions(procedures)  so this is the main drawback of the pop because the data is not secure it can be changed by any function if it is declared globally examples - C,COBOL,Fortran,Basic

OOP is object oriented language it was made to remove some of the drawbacks by the procedure orented language. Here the data is considered to be important hence it is not allowed to freely flow in whole programme. This language divides the programme into various entities known as objects and now the data and fuctions are build accross these ententities. An object is collection of the data and function the function can communicate with the other object function but the data remains entact
The object binds the function and data and protects it from the accidental modification from the other function examples - C++, java,python ,C# etc

### Additional Features of Object Oriented Programming  that is not pressent in pop

#### 1 - Object </br>
#### 2 - Classes </br>
#### 3 - Data encapsulation</br>
#### 4 - Data Hiding </br>
#### 5 - Data abstraction </br>
#### 6 - Inheretance </br>
#### 7 - Polymorphism </br>
#### 8 - Dynamic Binding </br>
#### 9 - Message Passing </br>
